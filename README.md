## SAS-Data-Analysis-Instagram-PowerPlants-NFT

# Project Description:

This project focuses on analyzing diverse datasets using SAS, covering Instagram influencer metrics, global power plant statistics, and NFT sales data. The primary objectives include importing and cleaning datasets, performing in-depth data analysis through summary statistics, and generating insights such as influencer rankings, power plant capacities, and NFT sales performance. Through the project, key understandings were derived, like influencer trends, energy production by fuel types, and high-value NFT transactions. The technologies used are SAS for data manipulation and analysis, with macro programming for dynamic dataset handling.

# Objectives of the SAS Assignment:

1. Data Import and Library Creation:

- Create and reference SAS libraries for organizing datasets.

- Import datasets like Instagram influencer data, global power plants, and NFT sales into SAS, ensuring valid variable names.

2. Data Exploration and Analysis:
   
- Explore datasets using SAS procedures like PROC CONTENTS, PROC FREQ, and PROC MEANS to gather insights.

- Summarize key data attributes and check for missing values, outliers, or inconsistencies.

3. Data Manipulation:
   
- Filter datasets by specific conditions and create temporary tables for focused analysis.

- Perform transformations like calculating averages, summing values, or deriving new columns based on existing data.

4. Statistical Insights:
   
- Generate detailed statistics, including mean, median, and standard deviation for numeric variables.
  
- Compare data between different categories (e.g., fuel types for power plants, NFT collections).

5. Dynamic Data Processing using Macros:
   
- Implement SAS macros for dynamic filtering and output generation, allowing flexible analysis across multiple datasets (e.g., analyzing both "Music" and "Lifestyle" influencer categories).

# Key Findings from the Assignment:

1. Instagram Influencer Data:

- Top Influencer: Cristiano Ronaldo is the top influencer with an Indian audience.
  
- Category Insights: 10 influencers belong to both the Music and Lifestyle categories.
  
- India Audience: 143 influencers (14.4%) have a significant audience in India.
  
2. Power Plant Data:

- Missing Values: 25 missing values were identified in the 2020 estimated generation capacity for Australian power plants.
  
- Median Capacity: The median generation capacity for Australian power plants was found to be 111 GWh.
  
- Solar Power: The average capacity of Australian solar installations was 60.3 MW.
  
3. NFT Sales Data:

- Top NFT Collection: Axie Infinity generated total sales of $3.33 billion.
  
- Group Analysis: 12 NFTs (4.8%) belong to the Cats group.
  
- Highest Transaction Value: The Deafbeef NFT had the highest average transaction value in the sorted NFT dataset.
  
- Group Comparison: CryptoPunks had the highest average transaction value in the Punks group.
  
These findings reflect the effectiveness of SAS for data import, manipulation, and analysis, leveraging its capabilities for handling large datasets and generating actionable insights.
